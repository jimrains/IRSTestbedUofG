# UofG Intelligent Reflecting Surface Testbed

Repository for the University of Glasgow's intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) hardware testbed brought to you by the Communications, Sensing, and Imaging (CSI) group. Development is continuing on two programmable metasurfaces. These devices will help researchers explore potential benefits of employing IRSs in wireless communications and RF sensing applications.

Here you will find code and documentation to aid in deploying with the two available IRSs in CSI group.
