The control circuitry of the 3-bit IRS is interfaced with an [Arty S7 FPGA development board](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-s7/reference-manual). The FPGA receives a 576-bit serial stream from a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and generates parallel digital streams to the 6 IRS tiles.
